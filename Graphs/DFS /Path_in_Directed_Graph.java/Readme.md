Question :
Given an directed graph having A nodes labelled from 1 to A containing M edges given by matrix B of size M x 2such that there is a edge directed from node

B[i][0] to node B[i][1].

Find whether a path exists from node 1 to node A.

Return 1 if path exists else return 0.
NOTE:
There are no self-loops in the graph.
There are no multiple edges between two nodes.
The graph may or may not be connected.
Nodes are numbered from 1 to A.
Your solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.

Problem Constraints

2 <= A <= 105
1 <= M <= min(200000,A*(A-1))
1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= A

Input Format

The first argument given is an integer A representing the number of nodes in the graph.
The second argument given a matrix B of size M x 2 which represents the M edges such that there is a edge directed from node B[i][0] to node B[i][1].

Output Format
Return 1 if path exists between node 1 to node A else return 0.
Example Input
Input 1:
A = 5
B = [  [1, 2] 
        [4, 1] 
        [2, 4] 
        [3, 4] 
        [5, 2] 
        [1, 3] ]
Input 2:

 A = 5
 B = [  [1, 2]
        [2, 3] 
        [3, 4] 
        [4, 5] ]
Example Output
Output 1:
 0
Output 2:
 1
Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
The given doens't contain any path from node 1 to node 5 so we will return 0.
Explanation 2:
Path from node1 to node 5 is ( 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 ) so we will return 1.

Pattern:
Graph Traversal ‚Äì Path Finding using DFS/BFS

This is a standard problem where we check if a path exists between two nodes in a graph.
- Use DFS (Depth-First Search) or BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Keep track of visited nodes to avoid infinite loops (cycles)
- Suitable for both **directed** and **undirected** graphs with minor adjustments

‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity
‚úÖ Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Where:
V = number of vertices (nodes) = A
E = number of edges = B.length
Breakdown:
Building adjacency list: O(E)
DFS traversal: visit each node once ‚Üí O(V)
Explore all edges once ‚Üí O(E)
‚û°Ô∏è Total Time: O(V + E)
‚úÖ Space Complexity: O(V + E)
Breakdown:
Adjacency list: O(V + E)
Visited array: O(V)
DFS recursion call stack: O(V) (in worst case)
‚û°Ô∏è Total Space: O(V + E)
