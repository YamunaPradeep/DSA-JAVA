"Another BFS" topic, which is based on edge weights 1 and 2, and learn how to convert it to 0-1 BFS format for efficient traversal.Problem Input:
Undirected graph
Edge weights: only 1 or 2
You need to find the shortest distance from source C to destination D.
Another BFS" = Single Source Shortest Path in 1/2 weighted graph
using Deque to simulate greedy traversal without priority queue
